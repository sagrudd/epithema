# ROADMAP

This roadmap converts the current EMBOSS-RS appraisal into a discrete task map.
The ordering is intentional: earlier items improve truthfulness and confidence
in the platform, while later items expand method coverage in governed sweeps.

## Standing Rules For All Tasks

1. Inspect and maintain `git status` throughout the task.
2. Any modification to code or documentation must remain tightly scoped to the
   essential files for that change.
3. Documentation must be maintained honestly and religiously.
   - Do not overstate provenance, validation depth, example coverage, or
     implementation completeness.
4. Rust code should prefer method-associated `.rs` files.
5. Where logic spans multiple methods, use discrete, logically named files
   rather than generic catch-all modules.
6. Any task that modifies repository content should end with review, commit, and
   push when the execution prompt requires commit and push.

## Task Map

1. Separate autodoc stub provenance from curated documentation.
   - Introduce an explicit distinction between registry-generated stub
     contracts and genuinely curated autodoc contracts.
   - Remove any implication that a generated baseline stub is equivalent to
     harvested or reviewer-curated method documentation.
   - Update generated page metadata so readers can tell immediately whether a
     page is stub-backed or richly curated.

2. Harden the documentation truth model.
   - Audit the current autodoc contract schema, generated Markdown rendering,
     and cohort-report projection for terminology that overstates maturity.
   - Align `source_mode`, provenance fields, and validation-intent wording with
     actual evidence levels.
   - Ensure that the docs site clearly distinguishes:
     - documented only
     - declared evidence
     - executable evidence
     - compared evidence

3. Complete a curated documentation sweep for the alignment family.
   - Target:
     - `aligncopy`
     - `aligncopypair`
     - `infoalign`
     - `extractalign`
     - `matcher`
     - `distmat`
     - `cons`
     - `consambig`
     - `needleall`
   - Replace baseline stubs with curated autodoc contracts containing real
     artifacts, declared examples, and honest validation intent.

4. Complete a curated documentation sweep for retrieval and archive methods.
   - Target:
     - `seqret`
     - `refseqget`
     - `runinfo`
     - `runget`
   - Document the current provider seams, local-versus-remote behavior,
     unsupported cases, and provenance boundaries explicitly.

5. Complete a curated documentation sweep for codon-analysis methods.
   - Target:
     - `cai`
     - `chips`
     - `codcmp`
     - `codcopy`
   - Add explicit example declarations, fixture references, and current
     limitations rather than leaving these methods on generic stub pages.

6. Build an acceptance anchor set with real compared evidence.
   - Select a small cross-family anchor cohort, for example:
     - `needle`
     - `seqret`
     - `extractfeat`
     - `maskseq`
     - `compseq`
     - `pepstats`
   - For each anchor:
     - harvest one historical example where practical
     - execute one governed validation case
     - capture at least one expected-output comparison

7. Add the first translation and ORF completion sweep.
   - Implement the highest-value retained translation-adjacent gaps:
     - `transeq`
     - `getorf`
     - `prettyseq`
     - `tranalign`
   - Reuse existing translation, interval, and typed reporting foundations.
   - Keep method logic in method-associated files and add only clearly named
     shared helpers where needed.

8. Add the first local-alignment completion sweep.
   - Implement:
     - `water`
   - Then assess the immediately adjacent retained gaps for follow-on work:
     - `diffseq`
     - `wordmatch`
     - `wordfinder`
   - Keep this sweep focused on local alignment and direct comparison rather
     than bundling broader alignment redesign.

9. Add the next feature and sequence-IO completion sweep.
   - Prioritise retained tools that extend the existing annotated-record path:
     - `coderet`
     - `featmerge`
     - `featreport`
     - `feattext`
   - Follow the existing feature-selection, extraction, and copying seams
     rather than introducing parallel feature models.

10. Add the next core statistics and metadata sweep.
    - Prioritise:
      - `infoseq`
      - `wordcount`
      - `cusp`
      - `dan`
    - Reuse the existing typed table-report path already established by
      `descseq`, `compseq`, `geecee`, and `pepstats`.

11. Expand plotting as a governed family, not a one-off.
    - Preserve R-owned rendering.
    - After `charge`, choose the next narrow plot-capable methods with simple
      contracts, such as one of:
      - `pepwindow`
      - `plotorf`
      - `freak`
    - Define plot contracts in Rust and render them only in `emboss-r`.

12. Reduce the “documented only” cohort count family by family.
    - Use the cohort validation report as the source of truth.
    - Each family sweep should explicitly reduce:
      - `documented_only`
      - `missing_validation_cases`
      - `missing_executable_evidence`
      - `missing_compared_evidence`

13. Keep the governance backlog and the shipped registry aligned.
    - Periodically reconcile:
      - governed retained methods in the scope matrix
      - currently shipped Rust registry methods
      - curated autodoc coverage
      - executable evidence coverage
    - Update roadmap ordering if a family’s retained gaps become more urgent
      than the current sequence.

14. Preserve release honesty while coverage grows.
    - Keep release/readiness reports explicit about what is complete versus
      what is merely scaffolded.
    - Do not treat page count, stub presence, or registry inclusion as a proxy
      for biological acceptance.
